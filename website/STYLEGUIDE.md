### Style guide

There are a few conventions we'd like to keep consistent for ease of learning and understanding. Here are the rules:

- Aim for simplicity in verbage and tone
- Use _italics_ (\_underscores\_) for file names, eg. _single-spa.config.js_
- End directory names with "/", eg. _src/_
- For code blocks that could use an associated filename, use the `.filname` class on a paragraph before it to achieve a "tab" style; eg. `<p class="filename">single-spa.config.js</p>`
- Indent code blocks using 2 spaces
